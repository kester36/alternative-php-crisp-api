## Alternative Crisp PHP API Client

Official Crisp API Client has some imperfections and this project triy to fix them. 

#### Work In Progress!

## Compare with official client

#### Preferences:

* Return full response data _(you will know was error or not)_
* Use namespaces (PSR-4)
* Use PSR-12 codding style
* Use popular HTTP client - guzzle/guzzle _(implements PSR-7 and PSR-18)_
* Fix some bugs

#### Compatibility:

* The same class and subclasses (properties) structure
* Different methods return data
* Different namespace
